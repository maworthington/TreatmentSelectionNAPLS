Are specific interventions more or less effective for different risk groups? 

This project is published as Worthington et al., 2020, Early Intervention in Psychiatry. 

This study examines the interaction between likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes and responsiveness to different interventions. 
Specifically, do higher-risk for psychosis patients benefit more long-term from a family-focused therapy intervention? 

This analysis incorporates previously calucalted likelhood scores for conversion to psychosis
These scores were calculated based on Cannon et al. 2016, American Journal of Psychiatry 

Factors included in calculating this risk score include: 
- Age
- Unusual thought content
- Persecutory delusions
- Stressful life events 
- Total traumas experienced 
- Family history of psychotic illness 
- Verbal learning scores 

This analysis also incorporates data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of family-focused therapy (FFT) vs. enhanced care (EC) in a population of clinical high-risk for psychosis youth. We also compared patients from a larger comparable study (NAPLS2) who were not included in the RCT but had symptom assessments available at the same time points. 

This dataset contains symptom information at baseline and 6 months 

The outcomes of interest include symptom change over 6 months and conversion to psychosis 


We found that higher risk individuals improved more with FFT than EC or no treatment, whereas lower-risk individuals. did not differ in positive symptom improvement across treatment groups. 

Intensive, specialized treatments such as FFT may be most appropriate for individuals at the highest levels of clinical risk for psychosis.
